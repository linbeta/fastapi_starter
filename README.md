# Get Start With FastAPI

found a cool repo [awesome-compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose) owned by [Docker](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose) officailly.

With the repo structure in the [fastapi](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/fastapi), it looks like a great starter to develop a FastAPI project.
